Runbook Solutions LLC was founded in 2025 to provide technology solutions for businesses that need assistance in modernizing their endpoint infrastructure. I've been working within the endpoint space for over 12 years with a heavy focus on modernization efforts. With that came working extensively with Group Policy, helping optimize policies for customers. Since then, I've focused on Microsoft Entra and Microsoft Intune with a goal of providing secure endpoints that also focus on customer usability. If you are interested in working with us, please reach out today to discuss!

Thank you,
